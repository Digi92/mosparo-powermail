    ..  accordion-item:: Does mosparo validation work with multi-step forms?
        :name: multistep-form
        :header-level: 2

        Currently, mosparo validation only works in multi-step forms if all fields to be validated are located on the same step as the mosparo form field type.
        If the fields are spread across multiple steps, validation will not be triggered correctly.

        | This limitation is known and currently being worked on. See the related issue on GitHub:
